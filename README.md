Classic game of Texas Hold'em in Java playable in Terminal.

At start of game, will ask how many players there are and how much money to start with. 

Each player dealt two cards as their hand, and can choose to either "check" or "bet". 

There will be a flop, a turn, and a river, and players can again, either "check" or "raise" during each. 

At the end, the best hand still that hasn't folded will win the pot!
